# gRPC Service Solution
  - This repository contains a .NET solution demonstrating a gRPC service with multiple client implementations, authentication, and a comprehensive testing suite.

#Overview
  
  - This solution showcases a modern approach to building scalable and maintainable gRPC services using .NET, featuring:
  
    • A Central gRPC Service – Hosts core business logic for high-performance, contract-first communication
    • Web API Gateway / BFF – Acts as a Backend-for-Frontend, translating HTTP/REST requests to gRPC calls for frontend clients.
    • A simple console client for direct interaction and testing.
    • Separation of concerns for authentication and authorization logic.
    • Comprehensive unit and integration tests for reliability and maintainability.
